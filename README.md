## General Info
An original statistical report where I analyse 268 records of depression, acculturative stress, and help-seeking behaviour as reported by students, both international and domestic, at an international university in Japan.

The dataset analysed is sourced from a comprehensive study published in the peer-reviewed open access journal Data by Nguyen et al. (2019), ‘A Dataset of Students’ Mental Health and Help-Seeking Behaviors in a Multicultural Environment’.

I analyse 2 key questions, applying data analytic techniques to support my response.
1. What levels of acculturative stress do international and domestic students experience?
2. What is the relationship between acculturative stress and depression for international and domestic students?

This project was completed individually from scratch as part of uni coursework. Final mark was 35/35.

## Technologies
The report and data analytic techniques were completed with R and R Markdown.
